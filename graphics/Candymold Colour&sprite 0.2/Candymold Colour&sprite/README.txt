Remember to back up your files before starting. This replaces files you might want later.

☞Installing:
1. Copy all the files in the MV or MZ verion.
2. Navigate to "Generator" in your RPG Maker folder. 
3. Open and paste. 


☞Contains:
-Male/Female/Kid TV sprite edit (with matching colour files)
-Gradient files (more colourful hair, more natural skintones)
    -30 skin colours (MZ)
    -48 hair colours (MZ)
    -17 eye colours (MZ)
    -31 clothing colours (MZ)


I tried to keep as many MZ colours as possible. There shouldn't be much missing.

    Editing OK

BONUS FOR MV/MV TRINITY RESOURCE USERS: 
-Unlike MZ, RPG Maker MV's sideview battlers have an unfinished look to their eyes too. I highly recommend Komyu-sho's sideview battler edits! Their pack has 13 sideview face options with gradient transparency on the hair, and a picture step-by-step. My gradients are based on Komyu-sho's more vivid colour ramps, so they should fit right in.

Note that MV and MZ have different poses. You'll have to manually copy-paste the heads if you want these on MZ characters. :P
